"""

Memo:
- N by N cells
- each cell could be core, cable or nothing
- edges cells are already connected to power
- connect power to core by cable
- cable should not overlap
- cable can only run straight, absolutely no tilting even at terminals

=> Minimum sum of cables lengths when connecting as many core as possible?

Rule:
- Cell state:
    - 0: empty
    - 1: core

Condition:
- cell size N -> 7 <= N <= 12
- Core count C -> 1 <= C <= 12
- there could be core that can't be connected

Plan:
0. row-first. (row, col), â†“ â†’ ordering
1. find already connected edge cores
2. put cable-required cores in queue
3. for each cores in queue find sides that can be connected
4. save terminal coordinates of cables connecting each of connectable sides
5. run brute force and find minimum cables with maximum connections
    5.a. check whether cables are crossing by using saved terminal coordinates?
    5.b. record entire cells cable takes and check if there's intersection?
