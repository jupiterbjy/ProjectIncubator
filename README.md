## Project Incubator

Thought that there was too many repositories I'm creating for something I can't assure its future for.

Therefore, I've created this repository to literally live up to it's name.

This will hold new ideas for repositories. When sub-project became clear, then will use ```subtree split```
to separate from subtree and create a new repository.

Mostly will look like a personal junkyard!
