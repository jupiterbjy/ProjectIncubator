[SingleScriptTools documentation](SingleScriptTools)

## Project Incubator

A personal junkyard, consisting various toy projects and tools that isn't huge enough to be its own repository!

If any gets larger (rarely happens), then it's split into separate repo, hence the name *Project Incubator*.

Mostly focused on [SingleScriptTools](SingleScriptTools),
which are sets of self-contained singular scripts focused on solving various problems I've encountered in my daily life.
